# THZ-image-classification

on-going project for my masters thesis. 
Brief explanation:
Teraherz wavelength (physical length - in milimeter scale) is extremely useful due to its non-ionizing properties as well as ability to go through paper, plastic and similar soft materials. However, there is not a lot of research done in the field due to the difficulty to produce the wavelegth.

What we have done:
- made a small dataset of THz images of different keys and screwdrivers
- made a dataset of THz images of keys that are hidden under other objects (net or metal plate)
- trained a small convolutional neural network which would classify the images
- trained UNET to detect screwdrivers and keys in the image

If you want to use our dataset or contact me for any other reason use ugnsili@gmail.com email
